# Abstract
Lately, smartphones became an everyday item in people lives. With appearance of the advanced operating systems, in parallel with the evolution of hardware, smartphones can have the same computing ability as a PC, but thanks to their size we can carry with us everywhere. This gives the opportunity to apps that use the advantage of portability, such as GPS and camera. In addition, social media got really famous, because everybody likes to keep in touch with their friends and share their experiences.


My application makes video sharing possible with our friends. To use the app first people have to register. After registration we can start following people and after that we can see their shared videos. With the app users can upload existing videos, and start live streams, from which others be notified so they wonâ€™t miss it.

I have created the application on Android platform, which is one of the most popular mobile operating system. To store data that are generated when using the app I use Firebase. I also use Firebase for authentication. Firebase is reliable, easy to learn and use, works great together with Android. For live streaming Firebase was not enough so I made my own server for this purpose which is running on Cloud.


The main goal of the thesis was about getting to know Android and real time communication, learn, and use Kotlin. Beside this, with building my own backend the process of mobile development became more transparent for me.
